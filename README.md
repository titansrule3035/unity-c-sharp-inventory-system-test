## 📂 Projects Overview  

Below is a curated list of projects, with links to their respective repositories and highlights of the technologies used.  

### 🔹 [C# To Do List](https://github.com/titansrule3035/solo-comp-sci-portfolio/tree/main/projects/CSharpToDoList)  

**Description:** A simple C# "To-Do List" console application that stores data into a text file.  
**Technologies:** C# .NET Framework, Microsoft Cryptography  
**Highlights:** Filestream and cryptography, the save file is obfuscated and then encrypted to prevent outside sources from reading/writing to sensitive data.  

### 🔹 [C# Calculator UI](https://github.com/titansrule3035/solo-comp-sci-portfolio/tree/main/projects/CSharpCalculatorUI)  

**Description:** A WinForms-based calculator application that supports full expression evaluation and floating-point numbers.  
**Technologies:** C# .NET Framework, WinForms  
**Highlights:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, decimal numbers, and full expression parsing with operator precedence, using **a custom, in-house, algebraic expression parser**. The UI includes a fixed-size window and an intuitive button layout.  

### 🔹 [Unity C# Inventory System Demo](https://github.com/titansrule3035/solo-comp-sci-portfolio/tree/main/projects/unity-c-sharp-inventory-system-test)    

**Description:** A demo "game" project in Unity showcasing a complete inventory system, dialogue system, debug system, and their interactions within a closed space.  
**Technologies:** C#, .NET Framework, Unity Engine, INK API  
**Highlights:** Easy-to-use inventory system with grab-and-drop based item functionality, item stacking, and item usage. The dialogue system is powered by the INK API, allowing for branching narratives and player choices. The debug system provides real-time feedback on game state and player actions.
